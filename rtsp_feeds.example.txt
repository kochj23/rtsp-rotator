# RTSP Rotator Feed Configuration
#
# This file defines the RTSP video feeds that will be rotated through.
# Save this file as ~/rtsp_feeds.txt for the application to use it.
#
# Format:
#   - One RTSP URL per line
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Whitespace is automatically trimmed
#
# RTSP URL Format:
#   rtsp://[username:password@]host[:port]/path
#
# Examples:
#   - Basic: rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream
#   - With auth: rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.100:554/stream
#   - Named host: rtsp://camera.local/live
#

# Example Camera Feeds (replace with your actual cameras)

# Office Camera
rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream1

# Lobby Camera
rtsp://192.168.1.101:554/stream2

# Parking Lot Camera
rtsp://192.168.1.102:554/stream3

# Warehouse Camera
rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.103:554/h264

# External Camera (with domain name)
rtsp://camera.example.com:554/live

# Notes:
# - Default RTSP port is 554 (can be omitted if using default)
# - Some cameras require authentication (username:password@)
# - Test URLs in VLC media player first to verify they work
# - H.264 codec is recommended for best compatibility
# - TCP is forced for all connections (reliable but slightly higher latency)
